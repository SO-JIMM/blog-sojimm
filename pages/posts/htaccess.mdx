`.htaccess` is an Apache configuration file that stands for 'hypertext access.'

These are text files used to invoke an exception to the global settings that apply to the various directories of an Apache website.

Placing the file in one directory will override the global settings that previously flowed down to that directory and its subdirectories.

The following `.htaccess` file contains the configuration of which file to serve when someone visits the domain:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

```apache
    Options -MultiViews
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
```
