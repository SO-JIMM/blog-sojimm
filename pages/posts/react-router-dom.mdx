import Image from "next/image"

`<Link />` component is an underlying `<anchor />` tag, however it navigates without refreshing your entire application.

`<BrowserRouter />` is what you'll use 99% of the time.

`<StaticRouter />` is what you might use if you are wanting to Server Side Render. You explicitly say what "page/component" you want to render.

`<HashRouter />` would be what you might use if you were working on a shared server and cannot alter your url. Anything after the `#` isn't technically partof our url.

`<MemoryRouter />` doesn't rely on the url bar and is stored in memory. This is useful for testing code as you may not be testing in an environment that accesses a browser.
